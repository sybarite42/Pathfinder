# Pathfinder

Find the shortest path from the player to the location clicked in a grid-based environment

Using the A* pathfinding algorithm programmed in C#


Point B - Location where the user has clicked

Player is the blue square and can move an 8 directions
Black tiles are impassable

Click a location to move the player to that location


Floors and walls are from a tilemap, and can be placed anywhere
although floors are just cosmetic and have no function


The algorithm detects whether a position is on the "blocking" layer or not
