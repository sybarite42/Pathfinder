# Pathfinder

Using the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path between 2 points in a grid/tile based game

Point A - Where the Player object is

Point B - Location where the user has clicked


Player is the blue square and can move an 8 directions
Black tiles are impassable

Click a location to move the player to that location


Floors and walls are from a tilemap, and can be placed anywhere
although floors are just cosmetic and have no function


The algorithm detects whether a position is on the "blocking" layer or not
